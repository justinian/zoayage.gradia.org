Zōayage, directly translated from the _Agehin_ tounge, is the _Isle of
Dragonflies_. The name has come to refer to not just the northwestern island
itself, but also the archipelago as a whole. It's a fantastical land inspired
by a fusion of Japanese mythology, tales of the Japanese Sengoku period, and
classic D&D tropes.
