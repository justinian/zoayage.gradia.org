Hosa is a tranquil village in a valley that's nestled amongst the foothills, at the edge of the Akyo mountains. The village is made up of a cluster of traditional wooden houses with thatched roofs, arranged in a seemingly haphazard manner along narrow, winding paths. Lush green rice paddies and vegetable gardens surround the village, fed by a small river that flows from the mountains, its waters cold and pristine.

Despite its remote location, Hosa is not entirely isolated. A narrow, well-trodden path through the forest connects it to larger towns in the province, allowing for occasional trade and news from the outside world. The journey to Hosa is arduous, involving steep climbs and treacherous passes, which ensures that only the most determined travelers reach its serene confines.

The surrounding landscape is breathtaking, with towering mountains cloaked in mist, dense forests filled with the sounds of wildlife, and the ever-present murmur of the river. The natural beauty and the peaceful, unhurried pace of life in Hosa make it a hidden gem, a place where time seems to stand still amidst the relentless march of history.
