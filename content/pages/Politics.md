While sovereignty is not always clear-cut in the Dragonfly Isles, there are
three main competing political powers that most polities in Zōayage pay at
least some fealty to: the Shogun in **Kama**, the High Priestess in
**Yoshima**, or the Ekh Khagan in **Krigh**.

## The Kama Shogunate

All of the provinces on the Northwest Island, as well as many on the other
islands, pay fealty to the Shogunate in the city of **Kama** on the Northwest
Island.

Despite the Shogunte's formidible military, most of its political power
comes from convenience and tradition. Provincial lords often vie for
power amongst each other, and war between them is not entirely uncommon.
Many provincial lords are vassals of others, forming a complex hierarchy
as the more powerful look to increase their holdings.

## The Yoshima Theocracy

The southern provinces on the Southwest Island have broken away from their
former fealty to the Shogun to follow a new religious leader in **Yoshima**.
This High Priestess and her new, monotheistic _Yoan_ religion have spread
quickly. What was merely a small cult 20 years ago is now a new state, twelve
provinces strong.

Where the old ways of the Agehin were a collection of animistic spiritual
beliefs, the Yaon religion is a strict and formal doctorine that demands
subservience.

## The Ekh Khaganate

The Ekh people on the Eastern Island are organized into a number of smaller
clan-based polities, but they are all loyal to the Ekh Khagan in *Krigh*.
Conflict and even battle between the different clans is considered normal,
though it happens far less than the Ekh have a reputation for.

Each Ekh polity sends a representative to Krigh to participate in the Khagan's
_Mót_, or representative assembly. While the Khagan has supreme power in war,
decisions that affect the Ekh as a whole are otherwise deferred to the Mót.
