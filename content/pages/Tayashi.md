Tayashi is a quaint coastal fishing town nestled along the rugged shores of Yugo Province. Surrounded by small but rocky cliffs and dense forests that give way to its bustling harbor, Tayashi is famed for its picturesque views and the bountiful waters that provide much of its sustenance and trade.

The architecture in Tayashi is a harmonious blend of wood and stone, with most buildings featuring thatched roofs and sliding doors, tailored to withstand the salty sea winds. The streets are narrow and often bustling with locals and traders alike. Central to the town's livelihood is the Fish Market, where the catch of the day is bartered fiercely from dawn until midday, filling the air with the calls of merchants and the scent of fresh seafood.

At the heart of Tayashi is the shrine, standing atop a small hill overlooking the town. It is dedicated to Ryāgi, the dragon god of the sea, believed to bless the fishermen with safety and a bountiful catch. Each year, the town hosts the Ryāgi Festival, a vibrant celebration with dances, music, and a ceremonial boat parade that lights up the entire harbor.

Despite its beauty and traditions, Tayashi is not without its troubles. The recent political shifts and the new regency have begun to seep into daily life, with increased taxes and the presence of the regent's samurai causing unease among the townsfolk. Rumors of strange occurrences and ominous figures seen in the foggy nights are whispered in hushed tones, adding a layer of mystery and unease to this otherwise serene fishing town.
