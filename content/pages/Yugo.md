Yugo is a remote and province on the eastern side of the main island of Zōayage.
Across the mountains from the hustle and political drama of the capitol, life in
Yugo had been mostly quiet until about a year ago.

Last year, the ruler of Yugo Province, Lord Kagae, was murdered along with all
of his heirs during a midnight raid on [Oyraraji](/pages/Oyaraji) Castle. Lord
Motōji, Lord of the neighboring [Samakiso Province](/pages/Samakiso) and long-time
friend of Lord Kagae, petitioned the Shogun for regency of Yugo and has been regent
of the province ever since.

However, Motōji's regency has not been a well-loved one. Where the former lord
had been generous to his people, Motōji is a miser and takes as much as he can
from the province for himself. Where Kagae had been open-minded and welcoming of
non-humans, Motōji treats them as lesser beings. The people chafe under the yoke
of Motōji and his brutal samurai, but the people of Yugo are loyal to the realm.
And they know they have no other option.

Everyone expects the Shogun to make Motōji the actual lord of Yugo within the
year. Yugo, once a calm and happy place, has become dour and withdrawn as their
plight looks to become a permanent one.
